                    Green Tea is a type of tea that is made from Camellia sinensis leaves that have not undergone the same withering and oxidation process used to make oolong and black tea. Green tea originated in China, but its production has spread to many countries in
                    Asia. Several varieties of green tea exist, which differ substantially because of the variety of C. sinensis used, growing conditions, horticultural methods, production processing, and time of harvest.

                <p class="card-text">
                    Black Tea is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, green and white teas. Black tea is generally stronger in flavor than the less oxidized teas. All four types are made from leaves of the shrub (or small tree) Camellia sinensis. Two principal
                    varieties of the species are used – the small-leaved Chinese variety plant (C. sinensis subsp. sinensis), used for most other types of teas, and the large-leaved Assamese plant (C. sinensis subsp. assamica), which was traditionally
                    mainly used for black tea, although in recent years some green and white have been produced.

                <p class="card-text">
                    Yellow tea is also known as huángchá in Chinese and hwangcha in Korean, is an increasingly rare and expensive variety of tea. The process for making yellow tea is similar to that of green but with an added step of encasing and steaming the tea. This allows
                    the tea to oxidize at a slower rate, producing a far more mellow taste than is found in most green teas; this also gives the leaves a slightly yellow colouring during the drying process. The tea is a cross between unoxidized green
                    tea and post-fermented dark tea

                <p class="card-text">
                    Oolong is a traditional Chinese tea produced through a process including withering the plant under strong sun and oxidation before curling and twisting. Most oolong teas, especially those of fine quality, involve unique tea plant cultivars that are exclusively
                    used for particular varieties. Different styles of oolong tea can vary widely in flavor. They can be sweet and fruity with honey aromas, or woody and thick with roasted aromas, or green and fresh with complex aromas, all depending
                    on the horticulture and style of production. Several types of oolong tea, including those produced in the Wuyi Mountains of northern Fujian, such as Da Hong Pao, are among the most famous Chinese teas.

                <p class="card-text">
                    White tea is not rolled or oxidized, resulting in a flavour characterized as "lighter" than green or traditional black teas. In spite of its name, brewed white tea is pale yellow. Its name derives from the fine silvery-white hairs on the unopened buds
                    of the tea plant, which give the plant a whitish appearance. The unopened buds are used for some types of white tea.

                <p class="card-text">
                    Puer Tea is a variety of fermented tea produced in Yunnan province, China, and named after the town of Pu'er. Fermentation in the context of tea production involves microbial fermentation and oxidation of the tea leaves, after they have been dried and
                    rolled. This process is a Chinese specialty and produces tea known as hēichá, commonly translated as dark, or black tea. This type of tea is different from what in the West is known as "black tea", which in China is called "hóngchá"
                    i.e. "red tea". The best known variety of this category of tea is pu'er from Yunnan Province, named after the trading post for dark tea during imperial China.
